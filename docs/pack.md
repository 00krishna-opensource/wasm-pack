# wasm-pack pack

The `wasm-pack pack` command is used to create a tarball of your wasm project
using the `npm pack` command. This is useful if you would like to create a
local tarball containing your package, without publishing it to the npm
registry.

You can read more about the `npm pack` command [here][npm-pack-documentation].
